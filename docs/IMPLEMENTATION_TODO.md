# Implementation TODO — Next-Up Product Initiatives

Queue of scoped-and-planned features waiting to ship. Each entry has a
concrete plan, estimated engineering budget, and the context needed to
start immediately without re-scoping.

Items ship on `main` directly. Land each as a single atomic commit (or
a tight series of two) so Lovable picks them up on the next sync.

## 1. Customer Photo-Upload Encouragement Flow

**Why:** The AI Photo Re-Appraisal system shipped in commit `122aaf3`
only works when customers upload photos. Right now photos are optional
and most customers skip them, so the suggest + auto-bump pipeline
rarely fires. This is the single highest-revenue product change in the
queue — one good decline-recovery email with photo upload can claw
back a five-figure deal per month.

**Goal:** Three new touch points that nudge customers to upload photos
with a clear "get a higher offer" incentive.

### Touch point 1 — Offer page upsell card

New card on `src/pages/OfferPage.tsx` below the hero price, shown when
`offered_price` exists and `photos_uploaded = false`:

```
📸 Upload photos, potentially increase your offer
Our AI can review photos of your vehicle and confirm the condition is
better than expected — which could mean up to $X more on your offer.

Takes 2 minutes · 6 photos recommended · Completely optional

[Upload Photos →]
```

The `$X` number is the dealer's actual `ai_auto_bump_max_dollars`
setting so it's truthful per dealer. Truthful numbers build trust;
vague "up to thousands more" language sounds like a scam.

### Touch point 2 — Decline recovery notification

New notification trigger `customer_offer_decline_recovery` wired into
`send-notification/index.ts`. Fires via email + SMS when:
- Customer taps "No thanks" on the offer page, OR
- Customer doesn't accept within 30 minutes of seeing the offer, OR
- `progress_status` moves to `offer_declined`

**Email copy:**
```
Hi {{customer_name}},

We saw you didn't accept the ${{offered_price}} offer for your
{{vehicle}}. Before you go — our system can potentially raise your
offer for free if the condition is better than you described.

Upload 6 quick photos: {{photo_upload_link}}

Our AI reviews them in 2 minutes, and if your car looks cleaner than
expected, your offer automatically goes up. No strings, no commitment.

— {{dealership_name}}
```

**SMS copy** (under 160 chars):
```
{{dealership_name}}: Your offer could go UP. Snap 6 quick photos and
our AI may raise your number in 2 min: {{short_link}}. Reply STOP.
```

Respects existing opt-outs + quiet hours because it flows through the
existing `send-notification` infrastructure unchanged.

### Touch point 3 — Result screen with three outcomes

New post-upload screen at `src/pages/UploadPhotos.tsx`. After photos
upload and the AI re-appraisal runs, show one of three screens based
on the result:

| Outcome | Screen | CTA |
|---|---|---|
| **AI bump applied** (auto or suggested) | Confetti + "Great news — your offer went up $X!" with new price | **[Accept New Offer]** |
| **AI confirmed reported condition** | "Thanks! Your offer of $X is confirmed." | **[Accept Offer]** |
| **AI saw worse condition** | "Thanks! Our team is reviewing your submission — we'll contact you shortly." | *(no auto-action)* |

**Critical rule:** The third case never shows the customer a lowered
number. Worsening recommendations always route to the Appraiser Queue
for a human to decide how to communicate (or simply hold the number).

### Bonus — Optional photo categories

Below the required 6 photos, a new "Unlock a bigger offer" section:

- Dashboard with engine on → "proves no warning lights" → up to +$800
- Tire tread close-ups → "newer tires" → up to +$400
- Service records → "regular maintenance" → up to +$600
- Clean interior → "cabin wear grade" → up to +$500
- Aftermarket upgrades → wheels, stereo, bed liner → varies

Each with its own upload slot. Gamified: "4 of 5 bonus items uploaded."
Each optional photo feeds more data into `analyze-vehicle-damage` so
the AI has a stronger signal for its condition call.

### Scope

- **Files touched:** `OfferPage.tsx`, `UploadPhotos.tsx`,
  `send-notification/index.ts`, new `src/lib/photoUploadIncentives.ts`
  helper, possibly new `customer_offer_decline_recovery` template
  rows in `notification_templates`
- **Migration:** New trigger key, optional `photos_prompt_seen_at`
  column on submissions for analytics
- **New edge function:** None (reuses the existing re-appraisal
  pipeline)
- **Estimated budget:** 1-2 days, single commit
- **Dependencies:** None — everything it needs is already on main
  (AI photo re-appraisal, analyze-vehicle-damage, notification system)

### Open questions before shipping

1. Should the decline-recovery email go out to customers who decline
   politely (clicked No) AND customers who just ghost (never replied)?
   Or just the politely-declined ones?
2. Do we cap the "up to $X" number at the dealer's `ai_auto_bump_max_dollars`
   or at the absolute cap across any bump they've ever done?
3. The bonus photo categories add complexity to the form — do we ship
   them in the same commit or as a follow-up?

---

## 2. Tread & Brake Depth Integration (Tekmetric first)

**Why:** Dealers manually type tread depth and brake depth into the
inspection sheet today, every time. The data has already been captured
by the service department — often by the dealer's own techs during a
recent oil change. The fact that it doesn't flow into the inspection
sheet is a pure workflow gap.

**Goal:** Auto-populate tread + brake measurements from the dealer's
shop management system when a customer appears in both systems.

### Integration landscape (research summary)

| Tool | API available? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Hunter Quick Tread / Quick Check Drive** | Yes, via WebOffice (private integrator agreement) | Drive-over laser, highest accuracy. Phase 3 target. |
| **Tekmetric** | Yes — documented REST API with OAuth2 | **Phase 1 target.** Independent-shop leader. `api.tekmetric.com`. |
| **Shop-Ware** | Yes — REST API | Phase 2. |
| **Mitchell 1** | Yes — REST API | Phase 2. |
| **CDK Service / Reynolds ERA** | Enterprise-only | Phase 4, big-group tier. |
| **Bosch / Beissbarth TireInspect** | No — CSV export to monitored folder | Phase 3.5, low priority. |
| **Uveye** | Enterprise API ($2,500/mo site fee) | Phase 5, only worth it for AutoNation/Group 1 scale. |
| **DualTread / handheld lasers** | No API at all | Never — use the QR handoff fallback. |

### Phase 1 — Tekmetric integration

**Why Tekmetric first:** Largest independent-shop market share, clean
documented API, fast OAuth2 setup, and the biggest % of our target
dealers use it. Most new installs in 2023-2025 picked Tekmetric.

**Data model:**
- New table `shop_system_connections`:
  - `dealership_id`, `system` (`tekmetric` | `shop_ware` | etc.),
    `external_shop_id`, `oauth_refresh_token` (encrypted),
    `connected_at`, `last_sync_at`
- New columns on `submissions`:
  - `tread_data_source` (`manual` | `tekmetric` | `shop_ware` | ...)
  - `tread_data_synced_at`
  - `brake_data_source`, `brake_data_synced_at`

**Edge function:** `shop-system-sync-tread-brake`
- Input: `{ submission_id }` OR `{ customer_phone, vin }`
- For each connected shop system:
  1. Look up customer by phone or VIN via shop system API
  2. Fetch most recent inspection with tire/brake measurements
  3. If found within 90 days, populate:
     - `submissions.tire_lf/rf/lr/rr` (32nd")
     - `submissions.brake_*` (mm or 32nd", converted if needed)
     - Set data source fields
  4. Write `activity_log` entry "Tread data synced from Tekmetric"
- Called from:
  - `AppraisalTool.tsx` "Pull Inspection Data" button (already
    exists — just route it through this new function)
  - `InspectionCheckIn.tsx` after VIN is captured (auto-sync if the
    customer is found)

**Admin setup:** New section under System Settings → "Shop System
Connections" with an OAuth-style connect flow (redirect to Tekmetric,
exchange code, store refresh token). One-time per dealer.

**Scope:**
- **Files touched:** `AppraisalTool.tsx`, `InspectionCheckIn.tsx`,
  new `src/components/admin/ShopSystemConnections.tsx`
- **New edge function:** `shop-system-sync-tread-brake`
- **Migration:** `shop_system_connections` table + submission columns
- **Estimated budget:** 2-3 days **with a Tekmetric dev account**.
  Without one, ship the skeleton (OAuth flow + pluggable abstraction)
  and wire real credentials when they're available.
- **Dependencies:** Tekmetric developer account + OAuth client ID

### Phase 1.5 — QR handoff for laser tools without an API

Before any real API integration lands, there's a zero-integration win:
a **"Laser Tool Handoff"** screen in the mobile inspection flow that
shows a big QR code the tech scans from their laser tool. The QR
deep-links into the inspection sheet with the tread/brake fields
pre-focused and a numeric keypad primed.

- Workflow today: tech takes laser measurement → walks to tablet →
  finds inspection sheet → finds the right field → types → repeats
- Workflow with QR handoff: tech takes laser measurement → scans QR
  on tablet → keypad pops up on their phone with the field already
  focused → types the number → hits enter → field on tablet updates
  via realtime subscription

**Files touched:** `InspectionSheet.tsx`, `MobileInspection.tsx`, new
`src/pages/LaserToolHandoff.tsx`
**Scope:** 1 day
**Ships independently of Phase 1 API work**

### Phase 2+ — Future phases

- **Phase 2:** Shop-Ware + Mitchell 1 integrations (add more shop
  system adapters to the `ShopSystemConnector` interface)
- **Phase 3:** Hunter WebOffice (direct laser-drive-over), requires
  Hunter integrator agreement
- **Phase 4:** CDK Service and Reynolds ERA (enterprise tier, needed
  for AutoNation-size deals)
- **Phase 5:** Uveye for fully-automated drive-through inspection

## 3. Handheld Laser / BLE Hardware Integration Plan

**Why:** Item 2 above targets the dealer's shop management system as
the source of tread/brake data. This item targets a complementary path:
**the appraiser's personal iPhone or iPad**, paired to a handheld laser
tool via Bluetooth or a lightweight API. Useful when the dealer doesn't
have a shop management system to read from, when the appraiser is
walking the service drive away from any terminal, or when the dealer
wants faster measurement capture than manual entry allows.

### Hardware landscape (researched April 2026)

| Tool | Cost | Tread | Brake | iOS connectivity | API/BLE surface |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bartec TECH600Pro + BT bridge** | ~$2,050 | ✅ Laser | ❌ | Bluetooth LE → Bartec Mobile iOS app | Published SDK (2024), REST endpoint on paired app |
| **Snap-on EPIC / Solus Edge + laser module + brake sensor** | ~$3,200 | ✅ Laser | ✅ Add-on | Bluetooth LE → ProLink iQ iOS app | Mitchell 1 Integration API (shared with Mitchell 1 shop system integration in Item 2) |
| **JumpStart TreadReader** | ~$950 | ✅ Laser (< 1s per tire) | ❌ | Native BLE to iPhone/iPad | Published BLE profile + iOS companion app with share-sheet export |
| **Innova Drivelink Pro** | ~$280 | ✅ Stylus laser | ✅ Via OBD2 ABS data | iOS via Innova Connect app | Published REST API + webhook-capable |
| **Hunter Quick Tread / Quick Check Drive** | Already-owned hardware | ✅ Drive-over | ❌ | None (PC-only WebOffice) | Private integrator agreement — Phase 3 in Item 2 |
| **Bosch / Beissbarth TireInspect** | Already-owned hardware | ✅ Drive-over | ❌ | No iOS | CSV folder poll only |
| **DualTread / generic handhelds** | $300-800 | ✅ Laser | ❌ | None | No API, no BLE — manual only |
| **Uveye** | $2,500/mo site fee | ✅ Drive-over CV | ✅ Drive-over CV | None | Enterprise API — Phase 5 in Item 2 |

### Recommended two-tool stack per appraiser

**For tread: JumpStart TreadReader ($950)** — BLE-native, iOS-native,
under 1 second per wheel, cheapest real option in the BLE class.

**For brakes: Innova Drivelink Pro ($280)** — OBD2 dongle that reads
the car's ABS module to extract brake pad wear data on a subset of
2018+ vehicles. **Coverage is not universal** — see the OBD2 Brake
Compatibility Matrix below. Always paired with a manual fallback
path (QR handoff or mechanical calipering) for the vehicles where
OBD2 brake data isn't available.

**Total hardware per appraiser: ~$1,230.** Half the cost of Snap-on,
covers tread on every vehicle and brakes on roughly two-thirds of
2018+ used inventory, all iOS-native.

### OBD2 Brake Compatibility Matrix (critical — read before shipping Phase 2)

OBD2 does **not** have a native standardized PID for brake pad
thickness. The SAE J1979 standard covers engine, emissions, and
transmission — nothing about brake friction material. "OBD2 brake
readers" work by querying the ABS/EBS module on the same CAN bus
using manufacturer-specific proprietary identifiers, which means
coverage varies dramatically by brand.

Two underlying data sources the ABS module may use:

**Source A — Physical pad wear sensors (authoritative):** A resistance
loop embedded in the brake pad that the ABS module reads. As the pad
wears, the loop resistance changes, and at the wear limit the loop
breaks. The ABS module can report a specific percentage or mm
estimate, and often per-corner resolution.

**Source B — Calculated pad life (estimate):** No physical sensor;
instead, the ABS module runs a usage model that counts brake
applications, weights by brake pressure and vehicle speed, and tracks
time since the last pad replacement (reset when a tech clears the
counter). Less accurate than physical sensors — typically ±5-10% on a
well-maintained car, ±15% on an abused one.

| Brand / Era | Data source | Accuracy | Per-wheel or per-axle | Innova reads it? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **BMW 2010+** | Physical sensor | ±2mm | Per-axle, some per-corner | ✅ Excellent |
| **Mercedes 2012+** | Physical sensor | ±2mm | Per-axle | ✅ Excellent |
| **Audi / VW / Porsche 2015+** | Physical sensor | ±2mm | Per-axle | ✅ Excellent |
| **Volvo 2016+** | Physical sensor | ±2mm | Per-axle | ✅ Good |
| **Ford 2018+** | Calculated % | ±10% | Per-axle only | ⚠️ Partial — label "estimated" |
| **GM 2019+** | Calculated % | ±10% | Per-axle only | ⚠️ Partial — label "estimated" |
| **Stellantis (Ram/Jeep) 2019+** | Calculated % | ±15% | Per-axle only | ⚠️ Partial — label "estimated" |
| **Hyundai / Kia 2020+** | Calculated % | ±15% | Per-axle only | ⚠️ Partial — label "estimated" |
| **Toyota 2018+** | Not exposed over OBD2 | — | — | ❌ Not readable |
| **Honda / Acura 2018+** | Not exposed over OBD2 | — | — | ❌ Not readable |
| **Subaru 2018+** | Not exposed over OBD2 | — | — | ❌ Not readable |
| **Nissan / Infiniti 2018+** | Not exposed over OBD2 | — | — | ❌ Not readable |

**Rough coverage of the post-2018 used-car population:**
- **Excellent reads** (physical sensor): ~20% — European luxury
- **Estimated reads** (calculated %): ~40% — domestic + Korean
- **No OBD reads at all**: ~40% — Japanese (Toyota/Honda/Subaru/Nissan)

### Practical gotchas

1. **Proprietary protocols break on firmware updates.** Manufacturers
   occasionally ship ABS firmware updates that break third-party
   readers. Innova updates their dongle database monthly to keep up.
   Expect 1-2% of reads to fail silently at any given time. The
   integration **must** log failures to `activity_log` so we can
   detect pattern breaks (e.g. BMW reads suddenly at 0% for a week =
   firmware update shipped).

2. **Manual fallback is never optional.** At least 40% of the used
   vehicle population (Toyota/Honda/Subaru/Nissan) cannot be read via
   OBD2 at all. Phase 2 ships alongside the QR handoff + mechanical
   measurement path (Phase 0) — it never replaces them.

3. **Never surface estimated brake % as authoritative.** The UI must
   show a visible "estimated" badge whenever `brake_data_source` is
   `obd_calculated_estimate`, and the appraisal sheet must explicitly
   note when a number came from a software model vs a physical sensor.

### Revised Phase 2 data model

- New column `submissions.brake_data_source` with values:
  - `manual` — typed in by hand
  - `mechanical` — from the QR handoff + caliper or laser
  - `obd_physical_sensor` — authoritative read from BMW/MB/Audi/etc.
  - `obd_calculated_estimate` — software model from Ford/GM/etc.
- New table `obd_brake_compatibility` keyed on `(make, year_min, year_max)`
  that the edge function consults before attempting a read. Saves
  wasted API calls on incompatible vehicles and lets us show the
  appraiser "OBD brake read not supported for this vehicle —
  measure manually" immediately instead of after a failed read.

### Revised Phase 2 flow

1. Appraiser plugs Innova OBD dongle into the vehicle
2. Edge function receives the webhook, pulls the VIN (universal
   1996+ read), decodes make + year
3. Look up `obd_brake_compatibility` to classify the vehicle into
   one of four tiers (excellent / partial / not-available / unknown)
4. **Excellent tier:** Read resistance-loop values, write to
   `brake_lf/rf/lr/rr`, label source `obd_physical_sensor`, confidence
   HIGH
5. **Partial tier:** Read calculated %, convert to mm estimate using
   make-specific coefficients, label source `obd_calculated_estimate`,
   confidence MEDIUM, UI shows "estimated" badge
6. **Not-available tier:** Skip OBD read entirely, route appraiser to
   the QR handoff flow for mechanical measurement
7. **Unknown tier** (rare): Attempt the read, log failure if it
   fails, fall back to QR handoff
8. Every read (success or failure) writes an `activity_log` entry

### Integration phasing

| Phase | Hardware | Integration type | Engineering | Hardware cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 0** | None | QR handoff screen in inspection sheet — tech scans tablet QR with their phone, gets a focused numeric keypad for each wheel/brake, realtime sync back to tablet. Zero BLE, zero API. | ~1 day | $0 |
| **Phase 1** | JumpStart TreadReader | iOS share-sheet URL scheme: tech captures 4 readings in JumpStart app → taps Share → picks "Open in Autocurb" → deep-links into inspection sheet with all four wheel values pre-filled. Zero BLE code in our app. | ~2 days | $950/appraiser |
| **Phase 2** | Innova Drivelink Pro | Wire Innova's REST webhook into our existing `receive-obd-scan` edge function. Appraiser plugs OBD dongle into the vehicle, Innova app calls our webhook, brake pad life populates. | ~1 day | $280/appraiser |
| **Phase 3** | Snap-on EPIC (for dealers who already own it) | Mitchell 1 Integration API — same integration path as the Mitchell 1 shop system plan in Item 2. Snap-on EPIC writes into Mitchell 1, we read from Mitchell 1. | ~3 days | $0 (existing hardware) |
| **Phase 4** | Bartec TECH600Pro (for dealers who already own it) | Bartec mobile SDK + their 2024 integration endpoint. Pair-once flow from System Settings. | ~2 days | $0 (existing hardware) |
| **Phase 5** | Direct Web Bluetooth to JumpStart | Capacitor/React Native shell exposing BLE to our admin PWA. Bigger architectural commit. Only worth it if Phase 1 share-sheet flow hits friction. | ~1 week | $0 (hardware from Phase 1) |

### Phase 0 detail — QR handoff screen (zero hardware, ships alone)

**Why it comes first:** It's a pure software win that helps every
dealer *today*, including the ones with no intent to ever buy new
hardware. The laser tool they already own stays in use; the QR handoff
just replaces the "walk to tablet → find field → type" loop with a
focused mobile keypad that auto-advances per wheel.

**Flow:**
1. UCM opens the inspection sheet on the tablet
2. Taps "Capture Tread + Brake" → a fullscreen QR code appears
3. Tech scans the QR from their phone
4. Phone opens `/inspection/:id/capture` with a single-screen form:
   four big wheel slots (LF / RF / LR / RR) for tread, four for brake
5. Each field focuses automatically, 32nd-inch numeric keypad, tap
   Enter to advance to the next wheel
6. Each value writes to the submission in realtime via Supabase
   subscription
7. Tablet shows the values updating live so the UCM can stop the
   tech if a number looks wrong
8. When all 8 values are in, the tech taps "Done" and both devices
   show a confirmation

**Files touched:**
- New `src/pages/InspectionCaptureHandoff.tsx` (mobile capture page)
- `src/pages/InspectionSheet.tsx` + `MobileInspection.tsx` — add
  "Capture Tread + Brake" button that shows the QR
- New route in `App.tsx`
- Uses existing Supabase realtime — no new edge functions

**Scope:** 1 day, ships independently of any other item.

### Phase 1 detail — JumpStart share-sheet integration

**Why:** Zero BLE code on our side. The JumpStart iOS app already does
the BLE pairing + reading; we just receive the export.

**Setup:**
1. Register a custom URL scheme in the app — `autocurb://inspection/:id/tread`
2. Document it in a "Connect Your Tread Laser" setup page for
   appraisers — configure JumpStart to share via our scheme
3. When the share-sheet URL hits the app, parse the query params
   (`?lf=8&rf=7&lr=6&rr=6`) and populate the inspection sheet

**Fallback if JumpStart's share export format doesn't include the full
per-wheel breakdown:** Use their iOS `UIActivityItem` copy format and
parse the human-readable text. Uglier but works.

**Scope:** 2 days + 1 JumpStart unit to test against.

### Open questions before any phase ships

1. Does the dealer already own a tread tool? We should ask during
   onboarding so Phase 0 (QR handoff) is the right default for
   existing-hardware dealers and Phase 1 (JumpStart) is the right
   recommendation for new-hardware dealers.
2. Do any target dealers own Snap-on EPIC? Phase 3 only makes sense
   if we have 3+ dealers asking for it.
3. Is brake pad data via OBD2 accurate enough for our condition model?
   Needs a 20-vehicle calibration test against mechanical
   measurements before Phase 2 goes live.

---

## Prioritization

If shipping one of these per sprint:

1. **Photo Upload Encouragement (1-2 days)** — biggest revenue impact,
   zero new dependencies, pure frontend + one notification template.
2. **Laser Tool QR Handoff — Phase 0 (1 day)** — zero-integration,
   zero-hardware quick win that helps every dealer immediately.
3. **Tekmetric Tread/Brake sync (2-3 days)** — needs a dev account but
   is the biggest operational upgrade in inspection workflow for
   dealers with shop management systems.
4. **JumpStart TreadReader integration — Phase 1 (2 days + $950 hardware)**
   — paired with Phase 0, closes the tread-capture loop without BLE
   engineering on our side.
5. **Innova Drivelink Pro — Phase 2 (1 day + $280 hardware)** — brake
   data via OBD2, reuses the existing `receive-obd-scan` endpoint.

First four items ship within 1.5 weeks of calendar time if done
sequentially. Full hardware stack (items 4 + 5) reaches every
appraiser for ~$1,230 in per-seat hardware, roughly one-third the
cost of the Snap-on equivalent.
